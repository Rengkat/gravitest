I can help you with any subject on the Nigerian curriculum — JAMB, WAEC, NECO, or Post-UTME.

**Here's what I can do:**
• Explain concepts in plain English (or Pidgin!)
• Solve maths and science problems step by step
• Give you past question breakdowns
• Share exam tips specific to your target school
• Generate practice questions on your weak topics

Pick a subject from the sidebar and ask me anything. What would you like to learn today?`,

    return `**Photosynthesis** is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.

The overall equation is:

\`6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂\`

### Two main stages:
1. **Light-dependent reactions** — occur in the thylakoid membrane; produce ATP and NADPH
2. **Light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle)** — occur in the stroma; use ATP and NADPH to fix CO₂ into glucose

For WAEC, remember that **chlorophyll** is the key pigment and is found in the **chloroplast**.`;

1. **First Law (Inertia)** — A body remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.

2. **Second Law (F = ma)** — The net force on a body equals its mass multiplied by its acceleration.
   - \`F = ma\` → force in Newtons (N), mass in kg, acceleration in m/s²

3. **Third Law (Action–Reaction)** — For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

### Quick exam tip:
When a question asks *"why does a gun recoil when fired?"* — that's Newton's Third Law. The bullet goes forward, the gun goes backward with equal momentum.`;

  if (q.includes("quadratic") || q.includes("equation")) {
    return `To solve a **quadratic equation** of the form \`ax² + bx + c = 0\`:

### Method 1: Factorisation
Find two numbers that multiply to \`ac\` and add to \`b\`.

### Method 2: Quadratic formula
\`x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\`

The expression \`b² - 4ac\` is called the **discriminant**:
- If **> 0** → two distinct real roots
- If **= 0** → one repeated root
- If **< 0** → no real roots (complex)

### Example (JAMB 2022 style):
Solve \`x² - 5x + 6 = 0\`
- Factors: \`(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\`
- **x = 2 or x = 3** ✓`;

${payload.userMessage.length > 60 ? `You asked about: *"${payload.userMessage.slice(0, 60)}…"*` : ""}

This is a **mock response** — the real Sabi-Tutor AI will provide a detailed, curriculum-aligned answer here once connected to the Anthropic API.

### To activate the real AI:
1. Create \`src/lib/api/ai-tutor.ts\` with your API route
2. Set \`NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_MODE=api\` in \`.env.local\`
3. Add your Anthropic API key to your backend route

Keep studying — you're doing great! 💪`;
